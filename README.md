## Star Wars Character Demo
This application does just about nothing. Certainly nothing that is at all useful. It's simply a playground for learning a few web technologies that are either new to me or new in general.

#### Bits & Bobs
* Angular 2
* Webpack
* Gulp
* Sass (scss)

#### To run the application:
1. install typings, gulp, and webpack globally  
    ```
    $ npm install gulp typings webpack -g

3. build the application
